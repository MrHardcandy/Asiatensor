**Enhancements:**
- **1500 Points Network**: Upgraded from 800 to 1500 points for desktop users (800-1200 on mobile/low-end devices)
- **Enhanced Distribution**: Implemented cube-root volume distribution for more uniform spherical nebula effect
- **Multi-Axis Rotation**: Added continuous rotation on X, Y, and Z axes for living, complex network sensation
- **Advanced Materials**: Added additive blending for ethereal glow effect on both points and connections
- **Dynamic Animation**: Complex pulsing with opacity variation and enhanced camera movement with subtle zoom
- **Optimized Performance**: Maintained performance with device-specific point counts and connection limits

**Technical Details:**
- Points: Up to 1500 with uniform sphere distribution
- Connections: Up to 6 connections per point with 3.2 unit max distance
- Rotation: 0.0008 (X), 0.0012 (Y), 0.0003 (Z) radians per frame
- Materials: Additive blending with animated opacity (0.9¬±0.1 points, 0.3¬±0.15 lines)

### üìñ Task 2: Sticky Section Headers in Appendix
**STATUS: COMPLETED ‚úÖ**

**Features:**
- **Intelligent Header Detection**: Automatically tracks H1 and H2 headers as user scrolls
- **Smooth Transitions**: Elegant fade-in/fade-out with translateY animations
- **Push-Away Effect**: Next header "pushes" current sticky header away with sliding transition
