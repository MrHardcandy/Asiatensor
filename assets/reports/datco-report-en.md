# Report: Global Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) In-Depth Analysis: Business Models, Valuation Framework and Market Landscape

## Chapter 1: Introduction: The Rise of Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs)

### 1.1 Definition and Characteristics: More Than Just Holding Cryptocurrencies

Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) represent a new type of publicly-listed companies emerging at the intersection of traditional finance (TradFi) and cryptocurrency. Their core definition is: **publicly-listed companies that make the accumulation of digital assets (usually Bitcoin) their core business function and primary strategy**. This definition precisely distinguishes them from companies that merely hold cryptocurrencies incidentally on their balance sheets. For example, Tesla, Bitcoin miners, or cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase derive their primary value from their traditional operational businesses, rather than strategic asset accumulation.

Becoming a DATCO requires meeting three key criteria:
- **Public listing**: Trading on major stock exchanges (such as NASDAQ, Tokyo Stock Exchange).
- **Substantial holdings**: Holding significant quantities of digital assets on their balance sheets.
- **Deliberate strategy**: Making asset accumulation the central element of their business model, rather than an incidental financial allocation.

The importance of this definition lies in isolating a unique class of investment vehicles. These companies leverage their listed status as a direct channel for accessing crypto assets, which is fundamentally different from companies that merely include cryptocurrencies as part of corporate treasury diversification. This distinction is the fundamental prerequisite for understanding their unique business models and valuation frameworks.

The emergence of DATCOs is essentially a structural innovation in capital markets. They bridge traditional finance and crypto ecosystems by "equitizing" crypto assets, providing familiar, regulated investment channels for institutional investors (such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments) who cannot directly hold digital assets due to compliance or regulatory restrictions. The logical chain of this process is clear: first, institutional investors face complex regulatory and compliance barriers in directly holding crypto assets; second, publicly-traded stocks are a standard asset class accepted by these institutions; third, DATCOs successfully convert an unregulated digital commodity into a regulated security by holding crypto assets on their balance sheets and issuing their own shares. Therefore, the core function of the DATCO model is not only asset accumulation, but also regulatory and structural arbitrage, opening a new pathway for massive institutional capital pools to enter the crypto world.

### 1.2 The Birth of DATCOs: From MicroStrategy's Strategic Transformation

The origins of the DATCO model can be traced back to 2020, pioneered by software company MicroStrategy (now renamed Strategy, ticker: MSTR) under the leadership of Michael Saylor. At that time, the company began converting its substantial cash reserves to Bitcoin, transforming it from a "sleepy software solutions company" into a high-beta investment proxy for Bitcoin, causing its market value to soar.

Understanding this founding story is key to grasping the core logic of this model: leveraging public companies' ability to raise capital (both equity and debt) more efficiently than private entities or funds to continuously acquire target assets. MicroStrategy's success created a replicable financial engineering strategy template, known as **"The Saylor Playbook"**. The core of this playbook is: select a listed entity (usually a growth-stagnant operating company or a cash-rich shell company), pivot its core corporate strategy toward asset accumulation, and use its public market financing capabilities as the funding engine. Today, this model is being explicitly replicated globally, with the most notable example being Japan's Metaplanet company, dubbed the "MicroStrategy of the East."

MicroStrategy's practice proved that markets are willing to grant these companies valuation premiums far above their digital asset net worth. This premium creates an arbitrage opportunity: companies can issue shares at high prices and use the proceeds to purchase underlying assets at effectively lower prices, creating value for existing shareholders. This financial engineering model is industry-agnostic, making the company's original business (whether software, biotech, or gaming) secondary, while capital raising and asset conversion efficiency becomes core. Therefore, the global rise of DATCOs is not an industry trend, but the diffusion of a specific financial strategy that can be applied to various corporate vehicles.

### 1.3 Why Choose DATCOs: Core Differences from Bitcoin ETFs and Mining Companies

For investors seeking crypto asset exposure, DATCOs offer a unique value proposition that differs significantly from Bitcoin spot ETFs and mining companies.

**Comparison with ETFs**: Unlike spot ETFs that passively track asset prices, DATCOs can actively and strategically raise and deploy capital, including using leverage (such as issuing debt, convertible bonds) to amplify their purchasing power. Additionally, ETF asset sizes fluctuate bidirectionally with fund flows in and out, while DATCOs are typically viewed as "one-way closed-end funds," with their acquisition behavior effectively locking up crypto asset supply in the market.

**Comparison with Mining Companies**: DATCOs also differ fundamentally from Bitcoin miners. Miners' value is tied not only to Bitcoin prices but also closely related to their operational efficiency, including energy costs, mining equipment efficiency, etc.

Fundamentally, DATCOs and mining companies offer two different forms of operational leverage. Choosing between them is essentially betting on two different operational capabilities. DATCO success depends on management's ability to navigate capital markets—timing equity issuances, managing debt structures, and leveraging stock premiums. Mining company success depends on their ability to navigate energy and hardware markets—securing cheap electricity and deploying efficient ASIC miners. DATCOs' primary "operations" are financial activities: issuing stocks, raising debt, purchasing crypto assets, with alpha returns sourced from financial acuity. Miners' primary operations are industrial activities: operating data centers, procuring energy, optimizing hardware, with alpha returns sourced from industrial efficiency. Both are proxies for underlying crypto assets, but their potential performance drivers are fundamentally different. Therefore, if investors believe a management team can excel in capital markets, they should choose DATCOs; if they believe the team can excel in energy and hardware markets, they should choose miners.

## Chapter 2: DATCO Business Model In-Depth Analysis

### 2.1 Core Strategy: Asset Accumulation as "One-Way Acquisition Vehicles"

DATCO business models are extremely focused, with their core strategy acting as **"one-way acquisition vehicles"**. Their primary objective is to continuously accumulate digital assets, drive up token prices, thereby attracting more users, developers, and decentralized applications (dApps), ultimately enhancing the entire ecosystem's visibility, especially among traditional investors.

The successful operation of this strategy relies on three ideal conditions:
- Digital asset prices are in a sustained upward trend.
- The company's equity maintains a high premium relative to its net asset value (NAV).
- Capital markets maintain liquidity and receptiveness to financing activities.

This model positions DATCOs as capital allocation machines rather than traditional operating companies. Their success metric is their ability to grow assets on a per-share basis.

### 2.2 Capital Formation Engine: ATM Offerings and PIPE Financing Operations and Impact

DATCOs primarily fund their asset acquisition strategies through two financial instruments: **At-the-Market Equity Programs (ATM)** and **Private Investments in Public Equity (PIPEs)**.

**ATM Offerings**: This is DATCOs' preferred financing method. ATM allows companies to issue new shares gradually and flexibly in the open market at current market prices, avoiding the steep discounts typically required for traditional large-scale offerings. ATM utility is maximized when company stock prices are above their per-share net asset value (NAV). In this situation, the value of crypto assets purchased with each ATM fundraising exceeds the dilutive effect of issuing shares, creating value for existing shareholders.

**PIPE Financing**: PIPE allows companies to conduct large-scale targeted financing quickly, but usually comes with significant equity dilution and may pressure stock prices in the short term, as PIPE investors often demand subscription prices at a discount to market price.

The DATCO business model can be understood as a flywheel driven by its own stock price premium that can be self-reinforcing (or self-destructive). When market sentiment is high and crypto asset prices rise, it drives DATCO stock prices, generating and maintaining a substantial NAV premium. This premium enables companies to conduct accretive equity issuances through ATM, with raised funds used to purchase more crypto assets. This behavior signals positively to the market, potentially further driving up asset prices and company stock prices, forming a positive feedback loop.

However, this flywheel can equally reverse. Once crypto markets enter a downward cycle and investor sentiment cools, stock price premiums may quickly disappear or even turn to discounts. At this point, any equity issuance becomes dilutive, and ATM financing channels effectively close. Companies are forced to halt asset acquisitions, sending negative signals to the market and potentially causing further stock price declines, falling into a vicious cycle. Therefore, the entire business model's survival is dynamically tied to NAV premium existence, making it inherently pro-cyclical and particularly vulnerable during market downturns.

### 2.3 Vehicle Evolution: Transformation Paths from Operating Companies (Opco) to SPACs

DATCO financial strategies are highly flexible and not limited to specific types of corporate vehicles. Evolution paths mainly include:

**Operating Company (Opco) Transformation**: This is the classic model where an existing listed company with core business operations undergoes strategic transformation. Usually, companies choosing this path have low "opportunity costs" for their original businesses, such as stagnant growth or abundant cash flows lacking investment channels. MicroStrategy (software business) and GameStop (gaming retail) are typical representatives of this model.

**Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)**: SPACs are listed shell companies established to raise funds through IPOs for acquiring unlisted target companies. In the DATCO model, SPACs can transform into pure DATCO vehicles by merging with companies holding crypto assets or planning crypto asset accumulation (De-SPAC transactions).

**Other Shell Companies (Shellco)**: Similar to SPACs, other types of listed shell companies can also be transformed into platforms executing digital asset treasury strategies through M&A restructuring.

Recently, Parataxis Holdings' acquisition of KOSDAQ-listed Bridge Biotherapeutics is the latest example of this transformation strategy. Through this transaction, a biotech company will be reshaped into South Korea's first institutionally-backed Bitcoin treasury company, renamed Parataxis Korea. This fully demonstrates how the DATCO model, as a financial strategy, can be grafted onto various types of listed entities, providing a potential transformation path for listed companies facing core business challenges.

### 2.4 Strategic Differentiation: Bitcoin-Dominant vs. Ethereum Yield-Bearing and Other Ecosystem Strategies

As the DATCO model develops, clear strategic differentiation has emerged internally. Initially, the model was dominated by Bitcoin-centered strategies, with MicroStrategy as the flagship. However, new trends are emerging, particularly in Ethereum and other ecosystem areas.

**Bitcoin-Dominant**: This is the most mature model, focusing on Bitcoin as the primary or even sole reserve asset. Its investment logic is simple and direct: becoming a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin price.

**Ethereum Yield-Bearing**: Ethereum-centered DATCOs, such as BitMine (BMNR) and SharpLink (SBET), have opened new possibilities. Due to Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, these companies can earn additional ETH rewards through staking their held ETH or participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to generate yield. This capability is currently unavailable with Bitcoin, providing companies with a "non-dilutive" revenue source.

**Other Ecosystem Strategies**: Some DATCOs choose to focus on specific blockchain ecosystems, such as Upexi (UPXI) focusing on Solana (SOL), while Tron Inc. (TRON) focuses on TRX. These companies' values are tied not only to specific token prices but also closely connected to their ecosystems' overall development and adoption.

Treasury asset selection fundamentally changes company business models, transforming them from pure-beta plays to potentially alpha-generating operating entities. A Bitcoin DATCO is primarily a leveraged bet on Bitcoin price, with income entirely dependent on capital markets (equity/debt issuance) and asset price appreciation. In contrast, an Ethereum DATCO introduces an operational element through staking, enabling it to generate income independent of price volatility. This operational income can be used to cover company operating expenses or purchase more assets without diluting shareholder equity, providing stronger resilience during flat or declining markets. Therefore, Ethereum DATCOs have two income sources: capital markets/price appreciation, and operational income from staking. This gives them theoretical advantages in capital efficiency and sustainability, although it also introduces new risks such as smart contract risks and staking protocol risks.

## Chapter 3: DATCO Valuation Models and Key Metrics

Valuing DATCOs requires a framework beyond traditional financial analysis, as it integrates asset management, financial engineering, and market sentiment dimensions.

### 3.1 Valuation Foundation: Net Asset Value (NAV)

**Net Asset Value (NAV)** is the absolute cornerstone of DATCO valuation. It represents the total value of digital assets held on the company's balance sheet calculated at current market prices. Any DATCO valuation analysis begins with calculating total NAV and per-share NAV. NAV provides a "floor price" or intrinsic value reference for the company's asset holdings, with all subsequent valuation discussions revolving around stock price deviations from this benchmark.

### 3.2 Core Driver: Equity Premium Relative to NAV (mNAV)

**Equity premium relative to NAV** is the most critical concept for understanding and evaluating DATCOs. It quantifies how much a company's market value (usually using enterprise value EV) exceeds its held digital asset net value (NAV). This metric is typically expressed as a multiple, i.e., **mNAV (multiple of Net Asset Value)**. For example, MicroStrategy's mNAV of 1.60 means its enterprise value is 1.6 times its held Bitcoin value.

This premium exists not due to market irrationality, but driven by multiple factors:
- **Compliant investment channels**: As mentioned earlier, DATCOs provide compliant exposure for institutional investors unable to directly purchase cryptocurrencies.
- **Scarcity value**: As one of the few such investment vehicles in the market, scarcity itself forms the basis for premium.
- **Operational leverage value**: Investors are willing to pay premiums for management's ability to increase per-share asset value through efficient capital operations (such as using premiums for accretive acquisitions).

mNAV is not only a valuation metric but also the fuel for DATCO business model growth engines. A sustained and high-level mNAV is a hallmark of successful DATCO operations.

### 3.3 Efficiency Metric: Bitcoin Yield

**Bitcoin Yield** is a key performance indicator (KPI) measuring a company's efficiency in growing Bitcoin holdings per diluted share over time. This metric reflects company capital efficiency—its ability to raise funds and convert them to Bitcoin without severely diluting shareholder equity.

A company might purchase large amounts of Bitcoin through massive stock issuances, but if this process causes excessive dilution to existing shareholders, its Bitcoin yield will be low, indicating poor capital operation efficiency. Research shows a positive correlation between higher Bitcoin yield and higher equity premiums (mNAV), as markets reward management teams that can efficiently accumulate assets for shareholders.

### 3.4 Comprehensive Valuation Framework: Narrative and Sentiment-Driven Factors Beyond Traditional Models

DATCO valuation cannot simply apply discounted cash flow (DCF) models suitable for traditional enterprises, as pure DATCOs' original business cash flows are nearly negligible. Their value is more influenced by narratives, investor sentiment, and their roles within specific asset ecosystems.

A more comprehensive valuation framework should include three core elements:

1. **Assets**: Current value of company-held assets measured by NAV. This is the objective foundation of value.

2. **Management Skill**: Management's capital allocation capability quantified by metrics like Bitcoin yield. An efficient management team can consistently create returns above market benchmarks for shareholders, deserving higher valuations.

3. **Market Narrative**: Market sentiment premium reflected in mNAV. This includes market beliefs about underlying asset futures, recognition of company strategies (e.g., leaders like Michael Saylor's personal charisma and vision), and convenience value of accessing exposure through regulated instruments.

Therefore, DATCO valuation can be conceptualized as a three-factor model. NAV is the benchmark value of company holdings. Bitcoin yield measures management efficiency in increasing NAV on a per-share basis, with high yields justifying higher premiums. mNAV reflects market's intangible beliefs about the future, including asset futures, company roles, and value of accessing assets through regulated instruments. A reasonable valuation formula can be understood as **NAV×f(Bitcoin Yield, Market Narrative)**, where premium (mNAV) is a function of management efficiency and market sentiment.

### 3.5 Key DATCO Valuation Metrics Comparison

To intuitively compare major DATCOs' valuation status and operational efficiency, the following table summarizes key metrics. By juxtaposing mNAV with Bitcoin yield, we can examine correlations between capital efficiency and market premiums.

| Company | Ticker | Primary Treasury Asset | NAV ($M USD) | EV ($M USD) | mNAV |
|---------|--------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|------|
| Strategy Inc. | MSTR | Bitcoin | $74,001 | $118,157 | 1.60 |
| MARA Holdings, Inc. | MARA | Bitcoin | $5,956 | $5,810 | 0.98 |
| Riot Platforms, Inc. | RIOT | Bitcoin | $2,264 | $4,100 | 1.81 |
| Metaplanet Inc. | 3350.T | Bitcoin | $2,223 | $1,050 | 0.47 |
| Semler Scientific | SMLR | Bitcoin | $591 | $550 | 0.93 |
| BitMine | BMNR | Ethereum | $4,960 | $6,200 | 1.25 |
| GameStop Corp. | GME | Bitcoin | $554 | $7,500 | 13.54 |

*Note: Data based on public information and market price estimates as of mid-August 2025. NAV primarily based on company-reported digital asset holdings multiplied by prevailing market prices. Enterprise Value (EV) and Market Cap sourced from financial data providers. mNAV calculations may vary slightly depending on EV calculation methods (whether including debt, preferred stock, etc.). GameStop's extremely high mNAV reflects its special market sentiment as a "meme stock," with valuation detached from fundamentals.*

## Chapter 4: Global DATCO Market Landscape and Regional Analysis

The DATCO phenomenon has expanded globally from its North American origins, presenting distinctive development paths across different regional markets.

### 4.1 North American Market: Mature Ecosystem of First Movers

The United States remains the global center of DATCOs, with the most mature and diversified company groups. Participants here are not only numerous but also strategically diverse.

**Bitcoin Giants**: Strategy (MSTR) as the model's pioneer leads in holdings. Following are major Bitcoin miners that are also significant Bitcoin holders, such as MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and CleanSpark (CLSK). While their primary business is mining, their massive Bitcoin reserves give them partial DATCO characteristics.

**New Entrants**: In recent years, increasingly diverse companies from different industries have joined this space, such as medical device company Semler Scientific (SMLR) and video game retailer GameStop (GME), both announcing large-scale Bitcoin purchase plans, marking DATCO strategy's cross-industry appeal.

**Ethereum and Other Assets**: Beyond Bitcoin, North American markets have also nurtured DATCOs focused on other digital assets, such as Ethereum-focused SharpLink (SBET) and BitMine (BMNR).

The Canadian market is equally active, with important listed miner-Bitcoin holding companies like Hut 8 (HUT) and HIVE Digital Technologies (HIVE).

### 4.2 Japanese Market: Emergence of "Eastern MicroStrategy"

Japan is rapidly becoming a new hotspot for the DATCO model, driven by unique macroeconomic backgrounds.

**Metaplanet's Rise**: Metaplanet Inc. (3350.T) has become Japan's market leader, explicitly stating it's replicating MicroStrategy's playbook through aggressive financing and acquisition strategies, rapidly accumulating substantial Bitcoin and earning the title "Eastern MicroStrategy."

**Broad Corporate Participation**: Beyond Metaplanet, other Japanese listed companies have also entered the field. Gaming giant NEXON (3659.T) purchased Bitcoin years ago. Additionally, companies like Remixpoint, gumi, ANAP Holdings, Convano (6574.T), and SBC Medical Group (SBC) have announced digital asset holdings or investment plans.

Japanese corporate enthusiasm for the DATCO model may relate to the country's unique macroeconomic environment. Prolonged ultra-low interest rates and persistent yen depreciation pressures make Bitcoin, as a non-sovereign store of value, particularly attractive to Japanese companies seeking to protect treasury reserves from domestic currency depreciation. From this perspective, Metaplanet's strategy may not just be speculation but a complex currency hedging behavior. The rapid rise of Japanese DATCOs may herald a broader corporate trend beginning—seeking assets sheltered from domestic monetary policy, a motivation perhaps less urgent in higher interest rate environments like the US.

### 4.3 South Korean Market: Early Signals of Institutional Entry

South Korea's DATCO market is still nascent but shows clear signals of institutional entry.

**First Institutionally-Backed DATCO**: Parataxis Holdings' acquisition of KOSDAQ-listed Bridge Biotherapeutics (288330.KS) aims to create South Korea's first institutionally-backed Bitcoin treasury company—a milestone event signaling the model's potential development in Korea.

**Retail Investor Enthusiasm**: Korean retail investors show strong interest in crypto-related stocks, such as enthusiasm for US-listed Ethereum treasury company BitMine, indicating market potential demand for such investment vehicles.

**Existing Corporate Holders**: Some major Korean listed companies, such as gaming companies Wemade and Neowiz, tech giant Kakao, and biotech company Celltrion, already hold crypto assets on their balance sheets. However, their holding motivations mostly relate to business ecosystem construction rather than pure treasury reserve strategies. Additionally, listed company bitmax (377030.KQ) is also a known Bitcoin holder.

### 4.4 Hong Kong Market: Listed Companies' Web3 Positioning

As an international financial center and increasingly important Web3 hub, Hong Kong's listed companies are also turning attention to digital assets.

**Web3 Strategic Positioning**: Hong Kong DATCOs typically position their digital asset strategies as part of corporate Web3 transformation rather than merely asset allocation.

**Major Participants**: Gaming company Boyaa Interactive (0434.HK) is an active participant, explicitly stating cryptocurrency purchases are important measures for Web3 business development and positioning. Image processing company Meitu (1357.HK) was an early large-scale crypto investor, though later fully cashed out profitably. Other participants include HK Asia Holdings (1723.HK), Inmediahk (03700), and Linekong Interactive (08267).

### 4.5 Other Regions: European and Emerging Market Exploration

DATCO model globalization trends are also apparent in European and other markets.

**Europe**: Germany's Bitcoin Group SE (ADE.DE), UK's The Smarter Web Company PLC (SWC.AQ) and Vaultz Capital (V3TC.AQ), France's The Blockchain Group (ALTBG.PA), Sweden's Safello (SFL.ST), and Norway's Aker ASA (AKER.OL) are all practitioners of this model in Europe.

**Emerging Markets**: In Brazil, Argentina, Thailand, and other locations, listed companies are beginning to include Bitcoin and other digital assets in their balance sheets, reflecting this strategy's global appeal.

### 4.6 Comprehensive Global Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) Directory

*Note: This list is not exhaustive, aiming to showcase representative companies. Business model type classifications are based on public information, with "Pure DATCO" indicating companies whose primary value proposition has shifted toward digital asset accumulation, and "Hybrid Opco" indicating companies maintaining original core businesses while making digital assets important treasury strategies. Miners are separately or jointly labeled due to business specificity.*

## Chapter 5: Case Studies

Through in-depth analysis of several representative companies, we can more concretely understand DATCO business models and valuation logic.

### 5.1 Strategy (MicroStrategy): The Pioneer

As the DATCO model's pioneer, Strategy (MSTR)'s case is foundational for understanding all elements of this model. Its strategic core is maximizing Bitcoin acquisition and holding through various financial instruments.

**Capital Structure**: MSTR uses not only equity financing (through ATM programs) but also innovatively employs large-scale debt instruments, such as issuing convertible senior notes and secured senior notes, to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. This makes it a highly leveraged Bitcoin investment vehicle.

**"Saylor Premium"**: MSTR's stock price has long enjoyed significant premiums relative to its Bitcoin NAV, with mNAV far above 1.0. This premium is called the "Saylor Premium" by markets, partially attributed to founder Michael Saylor's strong market influence and narrative ability as a Bitcoin evangelist.

**Dual Business**: Despite Bitcoin strategy dominance, MSTR still operates its traditional enterprise analytics software business. However, this business's revenue growth is relatively stagnant, with its contribution to total company valuation becoming negligible. Investors essentially view MSTR as a regulated, leveraged Bitcoin fund rather than a software company.

### 5.2 Metaplanet Inc.: Fast Follower

Metaplanet is a faithful executor and fast follower of the "Saylor Playbook" in Japan, demonstrating the model's replicability.

**Rapid Accumulation**: Since announcing its Bitcoin treasury strategy, Metaplanet has rapidly accumulated substantial Bitcoin through multiple financings at remarkable speed, quickly becoming one of the world's largest Bitcoin-holding listed companies.

**Financing Model**: Similar to MSTR, Metaplanet primarily finances through equity-related instruments, such as issuing new perpetual preferred shares to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy.

**Market Reaction**: Metaplanet's strategic transformation has caused tremendous reactions in Japanese capital markets, with its stock price experiencing dramatic volatility. Its case proves the DATCO model has strong appeal in mature capital markets outside North America.

### 5.3 BitMine / SharpLink: Ethereum Strategists

BitMine (BMNR) and SharpLink (SBET) represent the DATCO model's evolutionary direction, choosing Ethereum as their primary treasury asset and introducing new value creation dimensions.

**Yield-Bearing Model**: Unlike holding Bitcoin, holding Ethereum enables these companies to earn additional ETH rewards through staking. This is a non-dilutive revenue source that can cover operating costs or reinvest, improving capital efficiency. BitMine has become one of the world's largest ETH treasury holders.

**Valuation Differences**: This yield-bearing capability may affect their valuation models. When evaluating such companies, analysts may need to introduce "yield-like" metrics beyond NAV and mNAV to value cash flows from staking operations. This makes their valuation models more complex than pure Bitcoin DATCOs.

**Risk Changes**: Introducing staking and DeFi strategies also brings new risks, including technical risks (smart contract vulnerabilities), protocol risks (staking protocol centralization or governance issues), and liquidity risks (staked ETH may have lock-up periods).

### 5.4 Boyaa Interactive: Hybrid Opco

Hong Kong-listed gaming company Boyaa Interactive (0434.HK) provides an example of how hybrid operating companies integrate digital asset strategies.

**Web3 Transformation**: Boyaa Interactive hasn't abandoned its core gaming business but positions holding substantial digital assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins) as important measures for Web3 field transformation and positioning.

**Asset Allocation**: As of mid-2024, its held digital assets comprised an extremely high proportion (75%) of total company assets, demonstrating its strategy's aggressiveness.

**Performance Impact**: Digital asset fair value changes have become key factors affecting company net profit. During market upswings, this brings massive gains; conversely, during downturns, it causes significant losses. Boyaa Interactive's case illustrates that when traditional companies deeply engage in digital asset treasury strategies, their financial performance becomes highly tied to crypto market cyclicality.

## Chapter 6: Risks, Controversies and Future Outlook

While the DATCO model provides new opportunities for investors, it also carries a series of unique risks and structural controversies.

### 6.1 Inherent Risks: Premium Collapse, Market Volatility and Regulation

DATCO model fragility is rooted in its business model core.

**Premium Collapse Risk**: As mentioned earlier, equity premiums relative to NAV fuel DATCO growth flywheels. Once market sentiment reverses and crypto asset prices decline, these premiums may quickly disappear. This would disable ATM and other financing tools, preventing companies from making accretive acquisitions and falling into negative spirals.

**Market Volatility Risk**: DATCO balance sheets and stock prices are fully exposed to crypto markets' inherent high volatility. During bear markets, companies face not only substantial asset value shrinkage but also potential debt service pressures from leverage usage.

**Regulatory Risk**: Global regulatory environments for crypto assets continue evolving. Any adverse regulatory changes, such as restrictions on corporate digital asset holdings, stricter accounting standards, or tax policies, could fundamentally alter DATCO operating environments and investment attractiveness.

### 6.2 Structural Controversies: "Self-Dealing" and "Exit Liquidity Manufacturing"

The DATCO model, especially when applied to smaller market cap altcoin ecosystems, raises serious controversies about **"self-dealing"** and **"manufacturing exit liquidity."**

The controversy logic chain follows: First, crypto project (Project X) founders or early venture capitalists (VCs) hold large amounts of illiquid Token X. Second, they may participate in or fund establishing a publicly-listed DATCO. Third, this DATCO raises funds from ordinary investors through public markets. Fourth, the DATCO uses these public funds to purchase Token X in open markets, driving up prices and creating trading volume. Finally, founders or VCs can use this artificial liquidity and higher prices to sell their personally-held tokens, achieving exit.

Critics argue this structure amounts to **"self-dealing dressed up as capital deployment."** It's not genuine asset management but creating cash-out opportunities for insiders. While cases like MicroStrategy investing in Bitcoin are relatively clear, as Bitcoin is highly decentralized without obvious "insiders," when DATCO models are applied to projects with more concentrated token distributions and centralized governance structures, conflict of interest risks become prominent. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators may view such behavior as market manipulation or schemes providing preferential exit channels for insiders, posing significant legal and reputational risks for companies adopting such strategies.

### 6.3 Future Outlook: DATCO Model Sustainability and Evolution

DATCO model future sustainability depends on its ability to survive and evolve through different market cycles. Its long-term viability relies on three core conditions' continuity: long-term asset price uptrends, market willingness to grant valuation premiums, and open, receptive capital markets.

Future evolution may manifest in several aspects:

**Strategic Diversification**: From single Bitcoin holdings toward Ethereum and other yield-bearing assets, even diversified digital asset portfolios, to reduce single asset risks and increase income sources.

**Globalization Expansion**: With Japan, South Korea, and other markets joining, DATCO model globalization will continue deepening, with different regions' regulatory and market environments shaping distinctive DATCOs.

**Deep Integration with Core Business**: Hybrid Opcos may explore deeper integration of digital asset treasury with core businesses, such as using blockchain technology to improve products or services rather than merely passive asset allocation.

The ultimate test will be DATCO model performance after experiencing complete, potentially multi-year bear market cycles. Companies that can effectively manage leverage, maintain investor confidence, and survive adversity will prove the model's long-term resilience.

## Chapter 7: Accounting and Tax Treatment

For institutional investors, understanding DATCO accounting and tax treatment methods is crucial, as it directly affects corporate financial reporting and investors' actual returns.

### 7.1 Accounting Treatment: US GAAP vs. IFRS Differences

Different jurisdictions' accounting standards differ significantly in digital asset treatment, primarily between US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

**US GAAP**: In the United States, digital assets are treated as property rather than currency. According to the latest Accounting Standards Update (ASU 2023-08, i.e., ASC 350-60), companies holding crypto assets are required to use **Fair Value Measurement**. This means companies must adjust their held crypto assets to market prices at each reporting period end and include value changes in current period profit and loss. This change takes effect in 2025, enabling company book values and profits to more accurately reflect crypto assets' economic value.

**IFRS**: In many other countries and regions (including Europe and Hong Kong), companies typically follow IFRS. IFRS lacks specific crypto asset standards. According to International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) interpretations, cryptocurrencies are usually classified as intangible assets and use **Cost Model** for subsequent measurement. Under this model, assets are recorded at historical cost minus accumulated impairment losses. This means if asset prices rise, book values cannot be revalued upward; but if prices fall, impairment losses must be recognized.

These accounting standard differences create huge gaps between US and non-US DATCO financial reporting. US DATCOs following US GAAP report assets and profits fluctuating with crypto asset price volatility. European or Hong Kong DATCOs following IFRS have book values only reflecting declines, not increases. During bull markets, their balance sheets may severely underestimate true asset values, artificially inflating price-to-book (P/B) ratios and distorting cross-regional company comparability. Investors not understanding these fundamental differences may be misled when conducting global DATCO financial analysis and valuation comparisons.

### 7.2 Tax Treatment and Global Compliance Trends

Globally, digital asset tax treatment is becoming increasingly strict and clear.

**United States**: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats digital assets as property, with any digital asset transactions (such as sales, exchanges, or usage) potentially generating taxable capital gains or losses. Both corporate and individual investors must clearly report relevant activities on tax returns.

**Global Trends**: To combat tax fraud and evasion using crypto assets, global tax cooperation is strengthening. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched the **Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)**, aiming to establish global automatic tax information exchange standards. The framework requires crypto asset service providers (such as exchanges, brokers) to collect and report user transaction information to tax authorities. As CARF is implemented globally, space for corporate and individual tax avoidance through crypto assets will be greatly reduced.

## Appendix: Bitcoin Mining Company Valuation Introduction

To more comprehensively understand listed companies in crypto ecosystems, it's necessary to distinguish DATCO valuation frameworks from Bitcoin mining company valuation frameworks. Although many miners also hold substantial Bitcoin, their business models and value drivers differ fundamentally from pure DATCOs.

**Core Business**: Miners' core business is inputting hash power (computing power) to verify transactions and create new blocks, thereby earning Bitcoin as rewards. This is an energy-intensive industrial process.

**Key Operating Metrics**:

- **Hash Rate**: Measures total computing power of miners, usually in exahash/second (EH/s). Higher hash rates mean greater probability of earning block rewards in network-wide competition.

- **Mining Difficulty**: A dynamically-adjusted Bitcoin network parameter ensuring approximately one new block every 10 minutes. Higher difficulty means more hash power needed to mine equivalent Bitcoin quantities, indicating fiercer competition.

- **Electricity Costs**: This is miners' largest operating expense. Securing long-term, stable, cheap electricity is the most critical factor determining miner profitability and survival.

- **Mining Rig Efficiency**: Refers to mining rigs' (usually ASICs) efficiency in converting electricity to hash power, typically measured in joules/terahash (J/TH). More advanced rigs are more efficient, producing more hash power with lower energy consumption.

**Valuation Framework**:

Unlike DATCOs primarily valued based on net asset value and market premiums, mining company valuation more closely resembles traditional industrial or energy enterprises, focusing on cash flow generation capability. Analysts typically focus on these metrics:

- **Mining Costs**: Total costs to produce one Bitcoin, primarily electricity costs.
- **Hash Price**: Represents dollar revenue a unit of hash power (such as 1 TH/s) can generate in one day. This metric combines Bitcoin price, network difficulty, and transaction fees, serving as the core indicator of mining profitability.
- **Enterprise Value/Hash Rate (EV/Hashrate)**: Similar to traditional industry valuation multiples, used to compare different miners' valuation levels.

In summary, investing in DATCOs (like MSTR) is more like investing in leveraged, actively-managed asset holding vehicles, with value cores being assets themselves and management's capital operation capabilities. Investing in miners (like MARA, RIOT) is investing in energy conversion enterprises, with value cores being operational efficiency—how cheaply they can convert electricity to Bitcoin. Although both are highly correlated with Bitcoin prices, their risk exposures and value drivers differ fundamentally.
